<h2>ðŸ¦¾ About Me:</h2>

I've always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems.  
Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a foundation in programming languages like  **Java**, and **C**, along with hands-on experience in **Web Development** and **Machine Learning**.  
Iâ€™ve also worked with **Keras** to build and train machine learning models, and I enjoy exploring how AI can be applied to practical challenges.  
Currently doing an internship and excited to explore new roles in the field of **Information Technology**.  
I've also had the opportunity to work on several group projects, which has allowed me to hone my collaboration and communication skills.  
Outside tech, I enjoy **performing arts** like **singing** and **dancing** .
